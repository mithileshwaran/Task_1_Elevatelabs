# 🚨 Cyber Security Internship - Task 1: Port Scanning & Network Reconnaissance

## 🎯 Objective

To scan the local network using **Nmap**, identify active devices and open ports, and understand the risks of exposed network services.  
This task helped build practical skills in reconnaissance — the first phase of ethical hacking.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Nmap** (via Zenmap GUI)
- **Operating System:** Windows 10
- **Target IP Range:** `192.168.104.0/24`

---

## 🔍 Command Used


nmap -sS 192.168.104.0/24

 Zenmap Scan Result

 Security Observations

    Port 22 (SSH) was open – could be brute-forced if weak credentials are used.

    Port 80 (HTTP) was detected – transmits unencrypted data.

    Port 445 (SMB) – may be vulnerable to exploits like EternalBlue.

 What I Learned

     I learned how to use Nmap for scanning a local network using both command line and GUI (Zenmap).

     Understood the concept of IP ranges, port numbers, and services that typically run on each port.

     Practiced using the TCP SYN scan, and learned how it checks for open ports in a stealthy way.

     Gained awareness of the security risks involved when services like SSH, HTTP, and SMB are exposed.

     Learned how to write a README.md file in Markdown format, and organize files for GitHub submission.
